# Application registration

Before you can send any API calls to the bridge youâ€™ll need to register a username. Your
bridge will remember your username, and keeps track of when it was last used.

Multiple applications can be registered with the same username, as long as their devicetype
is different. It is currently unknown what effect this might have on the bridge.

You can <%= relative_link_to 'deregister a registered application through the configuration', '/api/config#deregistering-an-application' %>.
