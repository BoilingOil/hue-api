# Application registration

Before you can send any API calls to the bridge youâ€™ll need to register a username. Your
bridge will remember your username, and keeps track of when it was last used.

Multiple applications can be registered with the same username, as long as their devicetype
is different. It is currently unknown what effect this might have on the bridge.

## Registering an application

    POST /api

### Parameters

username
: numbers (0-9) and letters (a-z, A-Z), between 10 and 40 bytes in length (inclusive).

devicetype
: accepts any string, between 1 and 40 bytes in length (inclusive), used to label the application with a name.

### Input

<%= json "username" => "burgestrand", "devicetype" => "Ruhue API Client" %>

### Response

<%= json [{"success" => { "username" => "burgestrand" }}] %>

### Failures

Failure. Given an invalid username (too short), and an empty devicetype. Error
type 7 is for invalid values, and the description contains a human readable
string of what is wrong.

```json
[
  {
    "error":{
      "type":7,
      "address":"/username",
      "description":"invalid value, burges, for parameter, username"
    }
  },
  {
    "error":{
      "type":2,
      "address":"/",
      "description":"body contains invalid json"
    }
  }
]
```

A successful initial post, given a username of `burgestrand` and device type of
`macbook`.  As you can see, an error of type 101 means that the user needs to
press the link button on the Hue bridge, in order for it to allow new registrations.

```json
[
  {
    "error":{
      "type":101,
      "address":"",
      "description":"link button not pressed"
    }
  }
]
```

Same request as above example, but after the link button has been pressed. I am
currently unaware if there is a certain time this pairing needs to be done after
clicking the link button.

The username is used for subsequent API calls.

```json
```

## Deregistering an application

Removes a username from the whitelist of registered applications.

    DELETE /api/:username/config/whitelist/:username

### Response

<%= json [{ "success" => "/config/whitelist/burgestrand deleted" }] %>
